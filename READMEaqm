# Air Quality Monitoring System (IoT)

This project is an IoT-based **Air Quality Monitoring System** built with **ESP32**, **MQ-135 gas sensor**, and **DHT22 temperature & humidity sensor**.  
The system reads environmental parameters and uploads them to **ThingSpeak** for real-time monitoring and visualization.

## Features
- Monitors Air Quality (approx. VOC/CO₂ proxy using MQ-135)
- Monitors Temperature and Humidity (DHT22)
- Uploads data to **ThingSpeak** IoT platform
- Live dashboard with graphs
- Extendable to support accurate PM2.5/PM10 sensors (PMS5003, SDS011)

## Components
- ESP32 Dev Board
- MQ-135 Gas Sensor Module
- DHT22 Sensor
- Breadboard, jumper wires, USB cable

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `air_quality_monitor.ino` in Arduino IDE.
3. Install libraries:
   - `DHT sensor library` by Adafruit
   - `Adafruit Unified Sensor`
   - ESP32 board support in Arduino IDE
4. Update your **WiFi credentials** and **ThingSpeak API key** in the code.
5. Upload to your ESP32 and monitor via serial output.

## Cloud Visualization
- ThingSpeak is used for storing and visualizing sensor data.
- Create a free account at [ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com/).
- Create a channel and copy the **Write API Key**.
- Update the code with your API key.

## Example Dashboard
- Field 1: MQ-135 proxy values
- Field 2: Temperature (°C)
- Field 3: Humidity (%)
